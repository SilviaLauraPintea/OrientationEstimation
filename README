Social Groups Detection


Short Description:
______________________

The project has two main parts: the first part entails tracking people in real-time 
and estimating their orientation and pose; and the second part involves the detection 
of social groups given the estimated poses.

After tracking the people in the image, the orientation and the pose of each one of 
them needs to be estimated. 
The data used in this project is video data obtained from a single ceiling-mounted 
camera -- this makes the pose estimation task harder because of the presence of image 
noise, occlusion, clutter and difference in perspective.
A number of features and object recognition techniques need to be implemented and 
tested in order to discover an efficient one. 
The pose estimation part will mainly be carried out by using supervised learning 
techniques (data has to be annotated and classifiers have to be trained on a set 
of features that were found to be useful for this task).

Once an efficient way of estimating the poses is determined, the second part of the 
project involves finding a reliable way for using these pose estimations of the 
tracked people in order to detect the social groups present in the video and the 
dynamics of these groups.
