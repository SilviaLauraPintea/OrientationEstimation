Orientation Estimation


Short Description:
______________________
For the orientation estimation task the locations at which people 
are present in the image need to be determined and the orientation 
of each person needs to be estimated. The data used in this project 
is video data obtained from a single ceiling-mounted camera. This 
fact has two favorable properties: people do not occlude each other 
as much as in the situation in which the camera is positioned at 
human-level and the segmentation of people might be easier in 
crowded scenarios. On the other hand, this fact also entails two 
less favorable characteristics: occlusion by the background can 
affect substantially the position estimation and another problem 
is that the same person situated at different positions with respect 
to the camera will have different appearances due to the projection 
in the image plane. Unfortunately the last issue has a dramatical 
influence on the orientation estimation task.

A number of features and object recognition techniques have been 
investigated in order to discover an efficient one. The orientation 
estimation task was carried out by employing supervised learning 
techniques -- data has been annotated and learners have been 
trained on a set of features that were found to be useful for the 
goal of this project.
