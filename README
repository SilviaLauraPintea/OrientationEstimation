Social Groups Detection


Short Description:
______________________

The project has two main parts: tracking people in real-time and estimating their 
orientation and pose; and the second part involves the detection of social groups 
given the estimated poses.

After tracking the people in the image the orientation and pose of the people needs 
to be estimated. 
The data used in this project is video data from a single ceiling-mounted camera -- 
this makes the pose estimation task harder and number of features and object recognition 
techniques need to be implemented and tested in order to discover an efficient one. 
The pose estimation part will mainly be carried out by using supervised learning 
techniques -- data needs to be annotates and classifiers need to be trained on a set 
of features that were found to be useful for this task.

Once an efficient way of estimation the poses is determined, the second part of 
the project involves finding a reliable way for using the pose estimations of the 
tracked people in order to detect the social groups present in the video and the 
dynamic of these groups.
