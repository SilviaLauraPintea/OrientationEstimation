Group Detection


Short Description:
______________________

The project has two main parts: the first part entails tracking people in real-time 
and estimating their orientation; and the second part involves the detection 
of groups given the estimated orientations.

After tracking the people in the image, the orientation of each one of 
them needs to be estimated. 
The data used in this project is video data obtained from a single ceiling-mounted 
camera -- this makes the orientation estimation task harder because of the presence of image 
noise, occlusion, clutter and difference in perspective.
A number of features and object recognition techniques need to be implemented and 
tested in order to discover an efficient one. 
The orientation estimation part will mainly be carried out by using supervised learning 
techniques (data has to be annotated and classifiers have to be trained on a set 
of features that were found to be useful for this task).

Once an efficient way of estimating the orientation (facing direction) is determined, 
the second part of the project involves finding a reliable way of using these orientation 
estimations in order to detect the groups present in the video and the dynamics of 
these groups. The second part will be performed by exploiting available unsupervised 
learning techniques.
The difficulty that arises in this part of the project is the need for a robust 
method that would account for the possible inaccuracies resulted from the estimation 
of the orientation.
The fact that it is rather hard to acquire a good prior knowledge related to the 
number of groups present in a video is another challenge of this project. Thus, well 
known methods such as "Expectation Maximization" can not be applied efficiently on 
this task. A technique that should be considered when solving this task would be 
the "Dirichlet Processes".
